    <p> "Mary Oliver is saving my life,"Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Bakers novel "<a href="#">The
            Anthologist,</a>" scrawls in the margins of Oliver's <a href="#">"New and Selected Poems, Volume One."</a>.
        A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case off writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's
        lived for eight year, has just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the long-overdue
        introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turn to
        poet who have his touchstones <sup>__</sup> Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke, Sara Teasdale <sup>__</sup> before discovering Oliver. In her
        work, he finds consolation: "I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing." Of her poems, he says, "They're
        very simple. And yet each has something."<br/>
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I don't know exactly what a prayer is.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp into the grass , how to kneel down in the grass,
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp which is what I have been doing all day.<br/>
        <br>The cadences are almost Biblical. "Attention is the beginning of devotion," she urges elsewhere.<br/>
